This project is a random password generator. The user selects how long of a password they want (between 5-20 characters) & any special characters they want included in the random password generation process. After a user selects the "Generate Passwords" button, they are provided with 4 password options. They can continue to change their parameters and generate new passwords until they are satisifed.

PROJECT IMPROVEMENT IDEAS:
1. Create a "quick copy" button that copies the password option to a user's keyboard. It would do this on click of the "quick copy" button associated with that password.
2. Add error states for users that enter their own password length -- if it falls outside of the 5-20 length range the project was developed for.
